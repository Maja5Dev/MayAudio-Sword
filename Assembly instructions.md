## Assembly instructions:

1. Solder wires into the 3.5mm sockets.
2. Put heat inserts using a soldering iron into all 4mm holes. (2x holes for headband to screw in, 2x per Body, 5x per Chassis, 2x per driver holder)
3. Put micropore tape over the top left, bottom left and bottom right sides of vents on the Top Cover.
4. Put micropore tape inside of the driver holder without obstructing the bass port.
5. Cut the black dense foam (more see through one) from the Dekoni Foam Attenuation Kit to fit into the Driver Holder without obstructing the bass port (cut a hole).
6. Put the 3.5mm socket into the chassis and screw it in using a 4mm M3 screw.
7. Solder the driver to the 3.5mm socket.
8. Put the driver into the Driver Holder above the foam, make sure that the bass port goes into the driver magnet hole.
9. Put the Driver Holder with the driver into the Chassis.
10. Put the Body above the Driver Holder into the Chassis.
11. Screw in the Body using 4x 8mm M3 screws.
12. Put the Top Cover over the black dense foam from the Dekoni Foam Attenuation Kit and cut it to the Top Cover's shape.
13. Cut a few milimeters off the edges of the foam to make it fit in easier.
14. Put the foam in the back of the earpads behind the earpad skirt.
15. Put the Top Cover over the Body and screw it in using 4x 6mm M3 screws.
16. Put the earpads on.
17. Screw in the headband.

Bonus:
If you want to change the look, or just keep dust away, you can cut of the foams and put it in the back of the chassis. It will affect the sound.

Sound mods:
- If you want to have more bass out of this headphone, put micropore tape over more of the open vents of the Top Cover.
- If you want less bass, just cut out some of the micropore tape from the Top Cover.
- If you want less energy in the 2kHz area, skip adding the dense foam to the Driver Holder.
