## Assembly instructions:

(For the MF pads, skip step 5 and instead of putting micropore tape over 3/4 of the baffle, put only half)
(For the AHG pads, put more micropore tape, so that only two pairs of vents are open)

1. Solder wires into the 3.5mm sockets.

2. Put heat inserts using a soldering iron into all 4mm holes. (2x holes for headband to screw in, 2x per Body, 7x per Chassis, 2x per driver holder)

3. Put micropore tape over the top cover like the image below: (you can adjust the amount to your preference)

5. Put micropore tape inside of the driver holder without obstructing the bass port.

6. Put the 3.5mm socket into the chassis and screw it in using a 6/8mm M3 screw.
(Optional step: put any kind of very non-dense soft foam on the back to protect from dust)

7. Solder the driver to the 3.5mm socket. (Optionally for more bass): solder a 47 Ohm resistor between the right terminal of the driver to the right wire. (right = red)

8. Put the driver into the Driver Holder above the foam, and then put the bass tube into the driver magnet hole from the back.

9. Put the Driver Holder with the driver into the Chassis.

10. Put the Body above the Driver Holder into the Chassis.

11. Screw in the Body using 4x 10mm M3 screws.

12. Put the Top Cover over the Body.
Screw in the left and right holes with 12mm M3 screws.
Screw in the top and bottom holes with 6mm M3 screws.

13. Put the Top Cover over the **gray (if you use CG or AHG pads)** or **black dense (if you use MF pads)** foam from the Dekoni Foam Attenuation Kit and cut it to the Top Cover's shape.
  
14. Cut a few milimeters off the edges of the foam to make it fit in easier.

15. Put the foam in the back of the earpads behind the earpad skirt.

16. Put the earpads on.

17. Screw in the headband.

Bonus:
If you want to change the look, or just keep dust away, you can cut of the foams and put it in the back of the chassis. It will affect the sound.

Sound mods:
- If you want to have more bass out of this headphone, put micropore tape over more of the open vents of the Top Cover.
- If you want less bass, just cut out some of the micropore tape from the Top Cover.
- If you want less energy in the 2kHz area, skip adding the dense foam to the Driver Holder.
